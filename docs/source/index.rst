Welcome to Tachyonic's documentation!
=====================================

Release v\ |version|

Tachyonic software controls a large pool of services such as cloud, networking, dns, email throughout the infrastructure managed through a dashboard. The goal here is to have a single entry point for managing all services and exposing these services to tenants via one dashboard. Tachyonic scale is only dependent on the deployment method used and is designed to be massively horizontally scalable. All interfaces such as API endpoints and Dashboard views are fully extendible via plugins/modules. It's all open-source and completely customizable.
