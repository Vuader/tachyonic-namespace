Welcome to Tachyonic's documentation!
=====================================

Release v\ |version|

Tachyonic software controls a large pool of services such as cloud, networking, dns, email throughout the infrastructure managed through a dashboard. The goal here is to have a single entry point for managing all services and exposing these services to tenants via one dashboard. Integration with existing authentication database and CRM is done via driver interfaces. Tachyon scale is only dependent on the deployment method used and is designed to scale infinitely. All interfaces such as API endpoints and Dashboard views are fully extendible via plugins/modules. It's all open-source and completely customizable.

Users seeking commercial support for deployment will able to obtain this from any integrator familiar with open-source community.
